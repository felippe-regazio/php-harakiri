# PHP HARA-KIRI

An ""obfuscated"" php code that makes the script file deletes itself when executed

When any script reach this code *(at index.php)*, the script file will delete itself.
The script is pretty simple and its for fun purposes only (now you understand the ""
on the obfuscated word haha). 

Try to guess what the code is doing before looking at decode.php, its not that hard. 
Anyway, to understand what the index.php is doing, see the decode.php file.

If you already executed the index.php, heres a copy of the code

```php
<?php $ยง=(rawurldecode('%24__%3D%5B%22%3D%22%2C%22s%22%2C%22T%22%2C%22K%22%2C%22f%22%2C%22R%22%2C%22C%22%2C%22K%22%2C%22r%22%2C%225%22%2C%22W%22%2C%22a%22%2C%22s%22%2C%225%22%2C%22W%22%2C%22d%22%5D%3B'));eval($ยง);$_=__FILE__;eval(base64_decode(strrev(implode($__))));
```
